法新社记者：美国总统特朗普签署行政令，宣布对两个广受欢迎的与中国有关的社交网络软件TikTok和微信进行全面限制措施。请问中方对此有何评论？

<b>汪文斌：有关企业按照市场原则和国际规则在美开展商业活动，遵守美国法律法规。美方借口国家安全，频繁动用国家力量，无理打压非美国企业，这是赤裸裸的霸凌行径，中方坚决反对。我们也注意到，近期美国国内许多民众和国际社会很多人士都对美方有关做法提出批评和质疑。</b>

<b>“得道多助，失道寡助”。美方不惜损害美国广大用户和公司的权益，将一己私利凌驾于市场原则和国际规则之上，肆意进行政治操弄和政治打压，换来的只能是自身道德滑坡、国家形象受损和国际信任赤字，最终也将自食其果。</b>

<b>我们敦促美方认真倾听美国国内和国际社会的理性声音，纠正错误做法，不要将经济问题政治化，停止打压有关企业，为各国企业正常经营投资提供公平、公正、非歧视性的环境。 </b>

AFP: US President Donald Trump signed executive order on August 6 to restrict transactions with Chinese-owned social media like the owners of TikTok and WeChat in the US. So what's China's reaction to that?

<b>Wang Wenbin: Relevant companies have been doing business in the US in accordance with market principle and international rules as well as US laws and regulations. The US, under the pretext of national security, has time and again used state power to wantonly oppress non-US companies, which is nothing short of bullying. China firmly opposes that. We noted that such practice has triggered a flurry of doubts and criticisms from many Americans and people in other countries.</b>

<b>As a Chinese saying goes, "a just cause rallies abundant support while an unjust one finds little." The US side has put selfish interests above market principle and international rules to the detriment of US users and companies, and willfully resorted to political manipulation and oppression, which will only end up with its demoralization, eroded national image and trust deficit. All this will boomerang.</b>

<b>We urge the US side to heed the rational call at home and abroad, correct its mistakes, stop politicizing economic issues and bringing down relevant companies, and provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for the normal operation and investment of companies from all countries.</b>
